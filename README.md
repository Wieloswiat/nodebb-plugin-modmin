# NodeBB Plugin Modmin

This project was created thanks to support from [Linksjugend ['solid] Hamburg](https://linksjugend-hamburg.de/), represented by Artur Leier and Tom R.

This plugin adds a page at `/modmin` to allow non-admin users access to privilege and category controls. The user must have the "Manage Category" privilege for each category they want to manage, which must be given to them by a full admin, or an existing modmin.
